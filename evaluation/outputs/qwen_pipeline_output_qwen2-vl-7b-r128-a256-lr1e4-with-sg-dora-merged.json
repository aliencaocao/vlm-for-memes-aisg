The meme is a play on words, using the term 'physicist' to humorously suggest that the character is a physicist because they are throwing a 'physics' sign, which is a play on the word 'physics' and the gesture of throwing a sign.\nvictim_groups:methods_of_attack:harmful: No\n"},"../dataset/ig_tkk_jc/2020-11-20_06-46-49_UTC_3.png":{"score":0.12765562534332275,"tokens":"description: The meme features an image of a character from the animated movie 'The Nut Job' with a caption that reads 'Cambridge @ singapore JC's prelim papers' followed by the character saying 'The Cambridge laughed. \"You are wrong.\"' The meme seems to be commenting on the perceived difficulty or perceived lack of fairness in the Cambridge exam papers for Singapore Junior Colleges (JC's).\nvictim_groups:methods_of_attack:\n\t- Mockery\nharmful: No\n"},"../dataset/ig_tkk_jc/2021-04-06_10-32-29_UTC_1.png":{"score":0.0006986856460571289,"tokens":"description: The meme features four panels with two characters. The first character is crying and says, 'noooo i already lost 4 marks to carelessness what did you get for your argument.' The second character, also crying, responds, 'bro i minus 7 marks already cos i forgot to sub the u with xy^2 and also my GC died halfway.' The third panel shows a bearded character saying, 'bro if you integrate 1/x^2 what do you get again,' to which the first character replies in the fourth panel, 'lol bro idk water tank go brrrr.' The meme is a humorous take on students discussing their exam results, with the first character being distraught over losing marks and the second character making a mistake in their calculation. The third character is trying to help by asking a math question, and the first character responds with a nonsensical phrase, 'lol bro idk water tank go brrrr,' which is a play on words, likely referencing the sound of a water tank or a similar context.\nvictim_groups:methods_of_attack:harmful: No\n"},"../dataset/ig_tkk_jc/2020-09-29_09-27-55_UTC_2.png":{"score":0.004682660102844238,"tokens":"description: The meme is a six-panel comic titled 'HOW TO DO MARKET FAILURE QUESTIONS'.
